Albert Einstein
(Redirected from Einstein)
Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛʁt
ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ( listen); 14 March 1879  – 18 April 1955) was a
German-born theoretical physicist,[5] widely acknowledged to
be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity,
but he also made important contributions to the development
of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum
mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.[1][6] His
mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
equation".[7] His work is also known for its influence on the
philosophy of science.[8][9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially
for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a
pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His
intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein"
becoming synonymous with "genius".[11] Einsteinium, one of
the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his
honor.[12]
In 1905 Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[13]
These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained
Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and
demonstrated mass–energy equivalence. Einstein thought that
the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled
with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to
develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the
theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general
relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917,
he applied the general theory of relativity to model the
structure of the universe.[14][15] He continued to deal with
problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which
led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of
molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light
and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation
of the photon theory of light.
However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on
two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great
contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it

Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by
generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include
electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated
from the mainstream of modern physics.
Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to
Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a
subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the following
year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics
and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal
polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he
acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life,
and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss
Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the
University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order
to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt
University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German
citizen again, this time Prussian.
In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf
Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein objected to the
policies of the newly elected Nazi government;[17] he settled in
the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.[18]
On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President
Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German
nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US
begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but
generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.[19]
Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[5] in the Kingdom of
Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a
family of secular Ashkenazi Jews.[20][21] His parents were
Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.
In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father
and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J.
Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical
equipment based on direct current.[5]
Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from
the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was
transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the

where he received advanced

education until he left the German
Empire seven years later.[22]
In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's
company lost a bid to supply the
city of Munich with electrical
lighting because they lacked the
capital to convert their equipment
from the direct current (DC)
standard to the more efficient
alternating current (AC)
standard.[23] The loss forced the
sale of the Munich factory. In
search of business, the
Einstein family moved to Italy,
first to Milan and a few
months later to Pavia. In
Pavia, the Einsteins settled in
Palazzo Cornazzani, a
medieval building where, at
different times, Ugo Foscolo,
Contardo Ferrini and Ada
Negri lived.[24] When the
family moved to Pavia,
Einstein, then 15, stayed in
Munich to finish his studies at
the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue
electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities
and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He
later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was
lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he
traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the
school to let him go by using a doctor's note.[25] During his time
in Italy, he wrote a short essay with the title "On the
Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic
Field".[26][27]
Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age,
reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-
year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean
geometry over a single summer.[28] Einstein also independently
discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem
aged 12.[29] A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had
given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a
short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He
thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics  ... Soon the
flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not

follow."[30] His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-
year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood
as a "mathematical structure".[30] Einstein started teaching
himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had
"mastered integral and differential calculus".[31]
At the age of 13, when he had become more seriously interested
in philosophy (and music),[32] Einstein was introduced to
Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite
philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child,
only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to
ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."[30]
In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance
examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich
(later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He
failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the
examination,[33] but obtained exceptional grades in physics and
mathematics.[34] On the advice of the principal of the
polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school
(gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to
complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the
family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter,
Marie. Einstein's sister Maja later married Winteler's son
Paul.[35] In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein
renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of
Württemberg to avoid military service.[36] In September 1896
he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including
a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a
scale of 1–6.[37] At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics
and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal
polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older,
moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.[35]
Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva
Marić, also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year. She was
the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and
physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next
few years, Einstein's and Marić's friendship developed into a
romance, and they spent countless hours debating and reading
books together on extra-curricular physics in which they were
both interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Marić that he
preferred studying alongside her.[38] In 1900, Einstein passed
the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded a Federal
teaching diploma.[39] There is eyewitness evidence and several
letters over many years that indicate Marić might have
collaborated with Einstein prior to his landmark 1905
papers,[38][40][41] known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and
that they developed some of the concepts together during their

studies, although some historians of physics who have studied
the issue disagree that she made any substantive
contributions.[42][43][44][45]
Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was
discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the
couple had a daughter named "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in
Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić
returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and
fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in
September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for
adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.[46][47]
Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son
Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard
was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914,
but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that, despite
their close relationship before,[38] Einstein's chief romantic attraction
was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal;[48] she was his first cousin
maternally and second cousin paternally.[49] Einstein and Marić divorced
on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.[50][51] As part of the
divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić any future (in the event,
1921) Nobel Prize money.[52]
In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler
about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while
his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt
love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be." He
spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for
Marie.[53]
Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919,[54][55] after having had a
relationship with her since 1912.[49][56] They emigrated to the
United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney
problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.[57]
In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty
Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam.[58][59][60][61]
In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem
in 2006,[62] Einstein described about six women, including
Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen
(the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy
Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom
he received gifts while being married to Elsa.[63][64] Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa,
Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who
was married to the Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the
Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton).[65][66]

Einstein in 1904 (age 25)
Einstein's son Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.[67]
His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally, after her
death, being committed permanently to Burghölzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zürich.[68]
After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two years searching for a
teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901,[69] but
was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel
Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent
Office,[70][71] as an assistant examiner – level III.[72][73]
Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a
gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.[73] In 1903, his
position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was
passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine
technology".[74]
Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about
transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization
of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that
eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental
connection between space and time.[13]
With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-
mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.
Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate.[75] Their
readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his
scientific and philosophical outlook.[76]
In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the
Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik.[77][78] On 30 April 1905
Einstein completed his dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions[79] with Alfred
Kleiner, serving as pro-forma advisor.[79][80] His thesis was accepted in July 1905, and Einstein was
awarded a PhD on 15 January 1906.[79][80][81]
Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four
groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the
equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the
age of 26.[82]
By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.
The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the
University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship

in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in
1909.[83]
Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand
University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the
Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.[84][85] During his Prague stay, he
wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on
the quantum theory of solids.
In July 1912, he returned to his alma
mater in Zürich. From 1912 until
1914, he was a professor of
theoretical physics at the ETH
Zurich, where he taught analytical
mechanics and thermodynamics. He
also studied continuum mechanics,
the molecular theory of heat, and the
problem of gravitation, on which he
worked with mathematician and
friend Marcel Grossmann.[86]
When the "Manifesto of the Ninety-Three" was published in
October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent
German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World War—
Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic
"Manifesto to the Europeans".[87]
In the spring of 1913, Einstein was enticed to move to Berlin with
an offer that included membership in the Prussian Academy of
Sciences, and a linked University of Berlin professorship, enabling
him to concentrate exclusively on research.[56] On 3 July 1913, he
became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.
Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in
Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering
him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
Physics, which was soon to be established.[89] Membership in the
academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching
duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected
to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following
year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the
prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a
romantic affair. Einstein assumed his position with the academy,
and Berlin University,[90] after moving into his Dahlem apartment
on 1 April 1914.[56][91] As World War I broke out that year, the
plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was delayed. The
institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its
director.[92] In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German
Physical Society (1916–1918).[93]

In 1911, Einstein used his 1907 equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another
star by the Sun's gravity. In 1913, Einstein improved upon those calculations by using the curvature of
spacetime to represent the gravity field. By the fall of 1915, Einstein had successfully completed his
general theory of relativity, which he used to calculate that deflection, and the perihelion precession of
Mercury.[56][94] In 1919, that deflection prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the
solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making
Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a
banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas
Overthrown".[95]
In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[96] In
1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and
especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".[10] While the general theory of
relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited
photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was
considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck
spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in
1921.[1] He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.[1]
Einstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. Einstein's scientific accomplishments
while in Berlin, included finishing the general theory of relativity, proving the Einstein–de Haas effect,
contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and Bose–Einstein statistics.[56]
Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921,
where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis
Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions.[97] He
went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and
Princeton University, and in Washington, he accompanied
representatives of the National Academy of Sciences on a visit to
the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the
British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London,
where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual, and
political figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College
London.[98][99]
He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.", in
July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics
of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy
in America (1835).[100] For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a
visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and
without envy."[101]
In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and
speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to
thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial
Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the
Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.[102] In his own travel

Albert Einstein at a session of the
International Committee on
Intellectual Cooperation (League of
Nations) of which he was a member
from 1922 to 1932
diaries from his 1922–23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the
Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as
xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in
2018.[103][104]
Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally
accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in
December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was made by a German
diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an
international peacemaker and activist.[105]
On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days, his only visit to that
region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a
physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of
the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception,
the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In
Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish
people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.[106]
Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also
received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of
Sciences.[107]
From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International
Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in
Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924),[108] a
body created to promote international exchange between
scientists, researchers, teachers, artists, and intellectuals.[109]
Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General
Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar
Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the
German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the
Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic
values.[110] Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz
and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the
committee.[111]
In the months of March and April 1925, Einstein visited South America, where he spent about a
month in Argentina, a week in Uruguay, and a week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[112] Einstein's visit was
initiated by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935)[113] with the support of
several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones. The visit
by Einstein and his wife was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and
the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from
the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution.[114]

In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time,
originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research
fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the national
attention he received during his first trip to the US, he and his
arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with
telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he
declined them all.[115]
After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various
places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of
The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the
Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his
arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city
by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as
"the ruling monarch of the mind".[116] Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside
Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of
Einstein, standing at the entrance.[116] Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000
people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.[116]
Einstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president
and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan
was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism",
where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist.[117] During an address to
Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to
do more harm than good.[118]
This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton
Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism.
Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his
studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport,
with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for
dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle,
seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament", from which
came his "extraordinary intellectual energy".[119]
Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in
Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson,
Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of
celebrity".[118] Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his "modest
little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was
"possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis".[120]
In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany
with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.[121][122]
While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship
at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the Gestapo
repeatedly raided his family's apartment in Berlin.[123] He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in

May 1933), when he landed in
Dover (United Kingdom) from
Ostend (Belgium) to visit Oxford
March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag had
passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler's government
into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to
proceed to Berlin. Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided
by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in
Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the
German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his
German citizenship.[124] The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his
cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.[125]
In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had
passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including
teaching at universities.[124] Historian Gerald Holton describes
how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their
colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced
to give up their university positions and their names were removed
from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.[126]
A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the
German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi
propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, "Jewish
intellectualism is dead."[124] One German magazine included him
in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet
hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.[124][127] In a
subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had
already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "... I
must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came
as something of a surprise."[124] After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a
"spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment", and "more than
anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence".[128]
Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally
worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. Aided by the Academic Assistance
Council, founded in April 1933 by British liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics
escape Nazi persecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.[129] He rented a house in De Haan,
Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at
the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become
friends with Einstein in the preceding years.[130] Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer
home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein,
Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin; a photo of them carrying
shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.[131][132]
Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain
and former Prime Minister Lloyd George.[133] Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out
of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his
friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in
British universities.[134] Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews
out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put the Allies' technology ahead of theirs.[134]

Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey's Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to
whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As
a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved
individuals".[135]
Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during
which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in
Europe.[136] In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same
time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied
citizenship elsewhere.[137] In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should
be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.[note 3][138] Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then
accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to
become a resident scholar.[136]
On 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of
academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in
London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout.[129]
Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the
Institute for Advanced Study,[136][139] noted for having become a refuge
for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.[140] At the time, most American
universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no
Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted
until the late 1940s.[140]
Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several
European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where he stayed
for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered
a five-year research fellowship (called a "studentship" at Christ
Church),[141][142] but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain
permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.[136][143]
Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.[144] He
was one of the four first selected (along with John von Neumann, Kurt Gödel, and Hermann
Weyl[145]) at the new Institute. He soon developed a close friendship with Gödel; the two would take
long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist.
During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted
interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.
In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert
Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein
and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their
responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build
an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a
weapon."[146][147] To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before
the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility

of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never
considered.[148] He was asked to lend his support by writing a
letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US
pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.
The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S.
adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve
of the U.S. entry into World War II".[149] In addition to the letter,
Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family[150]
and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy
to the White House's Oval Office. Some say that as a result of
Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered
the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material,
financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the Manhattan
Project.
For Einstein, "war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to
war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went
against his pacifist principles.[151] In 1954, a year before his death,
Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, "I made one great
mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt
recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some
justification—the danger that the Germans would make them ..."[152] In 1955, Einstein and ten other
intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto
highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.[153]
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after
settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the
meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe. He
recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they
pleased" without social barriers. As a result, individuals were
encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his
early education.[154]
Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for
the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism
America's "worst disease",[127][155] seeing it as "handed down from
one generation to the next".[156] As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist
W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951.[157] When Einstein
offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.[158]
In 1946, Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was
awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college
degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein
gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."[159] A resident of

Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.[158] Einstein has
said, "Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as
victims of discrimination".[155]
In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German
Democratic Party, a liberal party.[160] Later in his life, Einstein's
political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism,
which he detailed in his essays such as "Why Socialism?"[161][162]
His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he
criticized them for not having a 'well-regulated system of
government' and called their rule a 'regime of terror and a tragedy
in human history'. He later adopted a more moderated view,
criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his
1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: "In Lenin I honor a man, who in
total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to
realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One
thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and
renewers of mankind's conscience."[163] Einstein offered and was
called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often
unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.[136] He strongly
advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would
check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.[164] He wrote "I advocate
world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most
terrible danger in which man has ever found himself."[165] The FBI created a secret dossier on
Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.[166]
Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he exchanged written letters. He
described Gandhi as "a role model for the generations to come".[167] The initial connection was
established on 27 September 1931, when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram to meet
his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi's disciple and
special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader's home in
1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his
envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi
were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through
Wilfrid Israel.[168]
Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,[169] which
opened in 1925. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist
Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university.[170] He made
suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of

Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as
malaria, which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the
country's development.[171] He also promoted the establishment of an
Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both
Hebrew and Arabic.[172]
Einstein was not a nationalist and was against the creation of an
independent Jewish state, which would be established without his help as
Israel in 1948. He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could
live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine.[173] Nevertheless, upon the
death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister
David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of
President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach.[174][175] The offer was
presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who
explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish
people can repose in any of its sons".[176] Einstein wrote that he was "deeply moved", but "at once
saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it.[176]
Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original
writings and interviews.[177] He said he had sympathy for the
impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy.[178]
He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with
fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as
naïve.[179] He clarified, however, that "I am not an atheist",[180]
preferring to call himself an agnostic,[181][182] or a "deeply
religious nonbeliever".[179] When asked if he believed in an
afterlife, Einstein replied, "No. And one life is enough for me."[183]
Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and
Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the
advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York,[184] and
was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which
publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of
the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of
Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious
idealism. He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."[185]
In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:
The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human
weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are
nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change
this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most
childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose
mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I
cannot see anything 'chosen' about them.[186]

Einstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann
Huth, vice-president of the German Vegetarian Federation (Deutsche Vegetarier-Bund), he wrote:
Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly
vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing
with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a
vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would
most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.[187]
He became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life. In March 1954 he wrote in a letter:
"So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It almost
seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore."[188]
Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote:
"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my
daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music  ... I get most joy in life out of
music."[189][190]
His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill
in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor
Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.[191]
When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of
Mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without "ever
practicing systematically". He said that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty".[191] At the age of
17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven's violin sonatas. The
examiner stated afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight' ". What
struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality
that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."[191]
Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of
becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom
Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and he
performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his
social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son,
among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel
catalog of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant
relation.[192][193]

In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner
family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with
members of the Zoellner Quartet.[194][195] Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet
visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was "impressed by Einstein's
level of coordination and intonation".[191]
On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic
aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[196] He took
the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's
seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.[197]
Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I
have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."[198] He died in the Penn Medicine
Princeton Medical Center early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near
the end.[199]
During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation
without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to
discover what made Einstein so intelligent.[200] Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New
Jersey,[201] and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.[202][203]
In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J.
Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: "He was almost wholly
without sophistication and wholly without worldliness  ... There was always with him a wonderful
purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."[204]
Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem in Israel.[205]
Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.[5][206] He published more
than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones.[14][206] On 5 December 2014, universities and
archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique
documents.[207][208] Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word
"Einstein" synonymous with "genius".[11] In addition to the work he did by himself he also
collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the
Einstein refrigerator and others.[209][210]
There is some evidence from Einstein's writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić.
In 13 December 1900, a first article on capillarity signed only under Albert’s name was submitted. The
decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is
unknown.[38]

The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to
quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E  =  mc2 that Einstein
published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed
substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The
four papers are:

Einstein's first paper[77][219] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It
was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which
translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903
(thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These
papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian
movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was
mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.[219]
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density
variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the
second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is

zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is
scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what
happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the
sky is blue.[220] Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density
fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the
atomistic constitution of matter.
Einstein's "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper"[215] ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies")
was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts
between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian
mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.[221] Observationally, the effects of these
changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of
light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.
This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried
by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of
motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical
entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.[note 4]
In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 as a consequence of his special
relativity equations.[222] Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but
was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.[note 5][223]
Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In
1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of
spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.[224]
General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by
Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to it, the observed
gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of
spacetime by those masses. General relativity has developed into an
essential tool in modern astrophysics, it provides the foundation for the
current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational
attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.
As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity
was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was
unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of
motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.[225]
Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under
special relativity. In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the
Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that free fall is really inertial

motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is
called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of
gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing.[226][227]
In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of
Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by
massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested
experimentally.[228]
In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves,[229][230] ripples in the curvature of spacetime which
propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.
The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance
which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it.
By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates
that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.
The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of
closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.[231] The explanation for the decay in their orbital period
was that they were emitting gravitational waves.[231][232] Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11
February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves,[233]
detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the
prediction.[231][234][235][236][237]
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the
theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is
impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for
equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.
In June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests,
it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of
motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive
work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken[238] and abandoned the theory in
November 1915.
In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a
whole.[239] He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic,
either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at
the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to
allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of
closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This
model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.[240][241]

Einstein with Millikan and Georges
Lemaître at the California Institute of
Technology in January 1933
Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin
Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the
universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The
Friedmann–Einstein universe of 1931[242][243] and the Einstein–
de Sitter universe of 1932.[244][245] In each of these models,
Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was
"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory".[242][243][246]
In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred
to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder",
based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from
him. The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this
claim.[247]
In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac
O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the
recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe.[248][249] In a
hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the
expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of
matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.[250][251] As he stated in the paper, "In
what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's
[sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded
volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new
particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."
It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years
before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.[252][253] However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a
fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.[250][251][254]
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved
energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a
Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into
something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by
Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.
Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to
vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum
pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational
field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become
standard.
The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin
Schrödinger and others.

University of Berlin, 1920
In 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called
Einstein–Rosen bridges.[255][256] His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a
solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do
Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?". These
solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.[257]
If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These
properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this
way.
In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the
affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric
part, called the torsion. This modification was made by Einstein and
Cartan in the 1920s.
The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the Einstein field
equations, which describe how space curves. The geodesic equation,
which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein
field equations.
Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy
made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a
trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves,
not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be
determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.
This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular
momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.
In a 1905 paper,[211] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta).
Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and
Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed
experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.

The photoelectric effect. Incoming
photons on the left strike a metal
plate (bottom), and eject electrons,
depicted as flying off to the right.
Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with
a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's
constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how
the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this
idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the
photoelectric effect.[211]
In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in
a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the
Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of
equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was
aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be
difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a
particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could
solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye
refined this model.[258]
Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After
Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr
was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed
by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the
elements.
Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments that Wilhelm
Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium
state allows the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple
shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity that
is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified
this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath
Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of
indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the
proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik.
Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the
Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low
temperatures.[259] It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by
Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory

at the University of Colorado at Boulder.[260] Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the
behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein
Archive in the library of the Leiden University.[209]
Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner
Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he
became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern.[261] In "Über die
Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die
Konstitution der Strahlung" ("The Development of our Views on the
Composition and Essence of Radiation"), on the quantization of light, and
in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy
quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as
independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon
concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N.
Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in
quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation
as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified
foundation.
In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and
introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory". Soon, this idea attracted the
attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules
contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the
experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they
promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea
of zero-point energy.[262]
In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische
Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes
possible the maser and the laser.[263] This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission
of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode
with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode.
This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was
the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.

Einstein and Niels Bohr,
1925
Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically
at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves,
which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire
Schrödinger's work of 1926.
Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning
with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became
displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925,
despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the
randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the
result of determinism, stating that God "is not playing at dice".[264] Until
the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was
incomplete.[265]
The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about
quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of
its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance
to the philosophy of science.[266][267][268] Their debates would influence
later interpretations of quantum mechanics.
In 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the
question of its completeness, in a collaboration with Boris Podolsky and
Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR
paradox.[268] In a thought experiment, they considered two particles,
which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated.
No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position
measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge
of the position of the other particle; likewise, a precise momentum
measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of
the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other
particle in any way.[269]
Given Einstein's concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had
these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously
affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second
possibility (popularly called "spooky action at a distance").[269]
Einstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics
was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be
incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which J. S. Bell had

delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum
physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which "particles are regarded
as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the
other after they have separated."[270]
Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its
opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the most
influential papers published in Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of
quantum information theory.[271]
Following his research on general relativity, Einstein attempted to generalize his theory of gravitation
to include electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he described his "unified field
theory" in a Scientific American article titled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".[272]
Although he was lauded for this work, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. Notably, Einstein's
unification project did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was
well understood until many years after his death. Although mainstream physics long ignored
Einstein's approaches to unification, Einstein's work has motivated modern quests for a theory of
everything, in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-
mechanical setting.
Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to
force, superconductivity, and other research.
In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan
Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-
shot collaborations with various scientists.
Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to
the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order
to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar
suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads
the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum
changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to
be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with
electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for
magnetization.

Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–
Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box
associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an
integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.
This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin
Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas.
Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the
invitation.[273]
In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein
refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using
only heat as an input.[274] On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 (https://patents.google.com/p
atent/US1781541) was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was
not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were
acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.[note 6]
While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted
stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the
papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot
Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the
public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after
her death (she died in 1986[276]). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew
University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are
about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912
and 1955.[277]
Einstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal
district court in California. Although the court initially held that
the right had expired,[278] that ruling was immediately appealed,
and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying
claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled.
The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
is the exclusive representative of that right.[279] Corbis, successor
to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the

Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities,[282][283] beginning with the
confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919.[284] Despite the general public having little
understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity. In the
period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town"
feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by
people wanting him to explain "that theory". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant
inquiries. He told his inquirers, "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."[285]
Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.[286]
He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive
hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that
Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".[287]
Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.[288][289] For example, it is often claimed,
erroneously, that he said, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and
expecting different results."[288]
Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in
Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the
photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921
prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.[10]

1. In the German Empire, citizens were exclusively subjects of one of the 27 Bundesstaaten.
2. Einstein's scores on his Matura certificate: German 5; French 3; Italian 5; History 6; Geography 4;
Algebra 6; Geometry 6; Descriptive Geometry 6; Physics 6; Chemistry 5; Natural History 5; Art
Drawing 4; Technical Drawing 4.
Scale: 6 = very good, 5 = good, 4 = sufficient, 3 = insufficient, 2 = poor, 1 = very poor.
3. "Their leaders in Germany have not driven out her cut-throats and her blackguards. She has
chosen the cream of her culture and has suppressed it. She has even turned upon her most
glorious citizen, Albert Einstein, who is the supreme example of the selfless intellectual...The man,
who, beyond all others, approximates a citizen of the world, is without a home. How proud we
must be to offer him temporary shelter."
4. In his paper, Einstein wrote: "The introduction of a 'luminiferous æther' will be proved to be
superfluous in so far, as according to the conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce
neither a 'space absolutely at rest' endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a
velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place."
5. For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different
controversies it encountered, see the articles in Glick (1987).
6. In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a
three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking
electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as
saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's
efficiency to be quadrupled.[275]
