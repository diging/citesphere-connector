Wave-particle duality

Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner
Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he
became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern.!2! In "Uber die
Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen tber das Wesen und _ die
Konstitution der Strahlung" ("The Development of our Views on the
Composition and Essence of Radiation"), on the quantization of light, and
in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy
quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as
independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon
concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N.
Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave—particle duality in
quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave—particle duality in radiation
as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified
foundation.

Zero-point energy

In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and
introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory". Soon, this idea attracted the
attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules
contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the
experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they
promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea
of zero-point energy.!2°2!

Stimulated emission

In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische
Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes
possible the maser and the laser.!2©3! This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission
of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode
with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode.
This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was
the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.
