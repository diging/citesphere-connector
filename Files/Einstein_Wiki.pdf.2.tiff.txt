Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium),
where he received advanced
primary and_ secondary school
education until he left the German
Empire seven years later.!22!

In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's
company lost a bid to supply the
city of Munich with electrical
lighting because they lacked the
capital to convert their equipment
from the direct current (DC)
standard to the more efficient
alternating current (AC)
standard.!23] The loss forced the
sale of the Munich factory. In
search of business, the
Einstein family moved to Italy,
first to Milan and a few
months later to Pavia. In
Pavia, the Einsteins settled in
Palazzo Cornazzani, a
medieval building where, at
different times, Ugo Foscolo,
Contardo Ferrini and Ada
Negri lived.'24! When the
family moved to _ Pavia,
Einstein, then 15, stayed in
Munich to finish his studies at
the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue
electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities
and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He
later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was
lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he
traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the
school to let him go by using a doctor's note.!25! During his time
in Italy, he wrote a short essay with the title "On the

Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic
Field" 126127!

Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age,
reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-
year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean
geometry over a single summer.!2®! Einstein also independently
discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem
aged 12.!29] A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had
given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a
short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He
thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the
flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not
