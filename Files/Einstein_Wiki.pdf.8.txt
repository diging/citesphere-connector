Einstein's official portrait
after receiving the 1921
Nobel Prize in Physics
Albert Einstein at a session of the
International Committee on
Intellectual Cooperation (League of
Nations) of which he was a member
from 1922 to 1932
diaries from his 1922–23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the
Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as
xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in
2018.[103][104]
Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally
accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in
December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was made by a German
diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an
international peacemaker and activist.[105]
On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days, his only visit to that
region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a
physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of
the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception,
the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In
Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish
people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.[106]
Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also
received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of
Sciences.[107]
From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International
Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in
Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924),[108] a
body created to promote international exchange between
scientists, researchers, teachers, artists, and intellectuals.[109]
Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General
Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar
Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the
German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the
Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic
values.[110] Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz
and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the
committee.[111]
In the months of March and April 1925, Einstein visited South America, where he spent about a
month in Argentina, a week in Uruguay, and a week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[112] Einstein's visit was
initiated by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935)[113] with the support of
several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones. The visit
by Einstein and his wife was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and
the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from
the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution.[114]
