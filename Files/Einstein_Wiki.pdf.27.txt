Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities,[282][283] beginning with the
confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919.[284] Despite the general public having little
understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity. In the
period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town"
feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by
people wanting him to explain "that theory". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant
inquiries. He told his inquirers, "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."[285]
Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.[286]
He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive
hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that
Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".[287]
Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.[288][289] For example, it is often claimed,
erroneously, that he said, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and
expecting different results."[288]
Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in
Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the
photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921
prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.[10]
