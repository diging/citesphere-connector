studies, although some historians of physics who have studied
the issue disagree that she made any substantive
contributions.[42][43][44][45]
Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was
discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the
couple had a daughter named "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in
Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić
returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and
fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in
September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for
adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.[46][47]
Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son
Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard
was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914,
but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that, despite
their close relationship before,[38] Einstein's chief romantic attraction
was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal;[48] she was his first cousin
maternally and second cousin paternally.[49] Einstein and Marić divorced
on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.[50][51] As part of the
divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić any future (in the event,
1921) Nobel Prize money.[52]
In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler
about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while
his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt
love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be." He
spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for
Marie.[53]
Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919,[54][55] after having had a
relationship with her since 1912.[49][56] They emigrated to the
United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney
problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.[57]
In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty
Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam.[58][59][60][61]
In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem
in 2006,[62] Einstein described about six women, including
Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen
(the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy
Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom
he received gifts while being married to Elsa.[63][64] Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa,
Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who
was married to the Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the
Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton).[65][66]
