of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never
considered.[148] He was asked to lend his support by writing a
letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US
pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.
The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S.
adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve
of the U.S. entry into World War II".[149] In addition to the letter,
Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family[150]
and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy
to the White House's Oval Office. Some say that as a result of
Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered
the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material,
financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the Manhattan
Project.
For Einstein, "war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to
war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went
against his pacifist principles.[151] In 1954, a year before his death,
Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, "I made one great
mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt
recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some
justification—the danger that the Germans would make them ..."[152] In 1955, Einstein and ten other
intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto
highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.[153]
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after
settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the
meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe. He
recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they
pleased" without social barriers. As a result, individuals were
encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his
early education.[154]
Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for
the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism
America's "worst disease",[127][155] seeing it as "handed down from
one generation to the next".[156] As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist
W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951.[157] When Einstein
offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.[158]
In 1946, Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was
awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college
degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein
gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."[159] A resident of
