motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is
called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of

gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing. [226112271

In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of
Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by
massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested
experimentally./22°!

Gravitational waves

In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, !229!I23°! ripples in the curvature of spacetime which
propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.
The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance
which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it.
By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates
that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of
closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.!231! The explanation for the decay in their orbital period
was that they were emitting gravitational waves.!231J/[232] Finstein's prediction was confirmed on 11
February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves,|233!

detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after’ the
prediction. !231/l2341l235]l236]12371

Hole argument and Entwurf theory

While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the
theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is
impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for
equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June 1913, the Entwurf (‘draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests,
it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of
motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive
work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken!23°! and abandoned the theory in
November 1915.

Physical cosmology

In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a
whole.!239! He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic,
either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at
the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to
allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of
closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This
model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.!240![241
