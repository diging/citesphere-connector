‘PaInftaIn] (listen); 14 March 1879 — 18 April 1955) was a
German-born theoretical physicist,'5! widely acknowledged to
be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity,
but he also made important contributions to the development
of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum

mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.H4[6 His

mass—energy equivalence formula £ = mc?, which arises from
relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
equation".!Z! His work is also known for its influence on the
philosophy of science. 8!L9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially
for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",1°! a
pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His
intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein"
becoming synonymous with "genius". Einsteinium, one of
the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his
honor.|#2!

In 1905 Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.!43!
These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained
Brownian motion, introduced _ special _ relativity, and
demonstrated mass—energy equivalence. Einstein thought that
the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled
with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to
develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the
theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general
relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917,
he applied the general theory of relativity to model the
structure of the universe.4/5! He continued to deal with
problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which
led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of
molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light
and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation
of the photon theory of light.

However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on
two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great
contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it
