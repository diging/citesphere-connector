The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to
quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc? that Einstein
published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed
substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The
four papers are:

Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics

Einstein's first paper!77![219! submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It
was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritatserscheinungen", which
translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902-1903
(thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These
papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian
movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was

mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.!2!2!

Theory of critical opalescence

Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density
variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the
second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is
