malaria, which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the
country's development.7! He also promoted the establishment of an
Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both
Hebrew and Arabic.#72!

Einstein was not a nationalist and was against the creation of an
independent Jewish state, which would be established without his help as
Israel in 1948. He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could
live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine.!!73! Nevertheless, upon the
death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister
David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of
President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach.!474!475! The offer was
presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who
explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish
people can repose in any of its sons".!476! Einstein wrote that he was "deeply moved", but "at once
saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it./17®!

advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York,484! and

“Ladies (coughs) and gentlemen,
Our age is proud of the progress it
has made in man's intellectual
development. The search and
striving for truth and knowledge is
one of the highest of man's
qualities ..."

Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious
idealism. He observed, "Without ‘ethical culture’ there is no salvation for humanity."!85]

In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:

The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human
weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are
nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change
this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most
childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose
mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I

cannot see anything ‘chosen’ about them.!!8°!
