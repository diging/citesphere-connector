The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to
quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E  =  mc2 that Einstein
published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed
substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The
four papers are:
Title (translated) Area of focus Received Published Significance
"On a Heuristic Viewpoint
Concerning the
Production and
Transformation of
Light"[211]
Photoelectric
effect 18 March 9 June
Resolved an unsolved puzzle by
suggesting that energy is exchanged
only in discrete amounts
(quanta).[212] This idea was pivotal to
the early development of quantum
theory.[213]
"On the Motion of Small
Particles Suspended in a
Stationary Liquid, as
Required by the
Molecular Kinetic Theory
of Heat"[214]
Brownian
motion 11 May 18 July
Explained empirical evidence for the
atomic theory, supporting the
application of statistical physics.
"On the Electrodynamics
of Moving Bodies"[215]
Special
relativity 30 June 26 September
Reconciled Maxwell's equations for
electricity and magnetism with the
laws of mechanics by introducing
changes to mechanics, resulting from
analysis based on empirical evidence
that the speed of light is independent
of the motion of the observer.[216]
Discredited the concept of a
"luminiferous ether".[217]
"Does the Inertia of a
Body Depend Upon Its
Energy Content?"[218]
Matter–energy
equivalence 27 September 21 November
Equivalence of matter and energy,
E = mc2, the existence of "rest
energy", and the basis of nuclear
energy.
Einstein's first paper[77][219] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It
was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which
translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903
(thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These
papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian
movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was
mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.[219]
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density
variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the
second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is
