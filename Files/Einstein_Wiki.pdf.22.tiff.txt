Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency fis associated with
a collection of photons with energy hf each, where fh is Planck's
constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how
the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this
idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the
photoelectric effect.!2!1J

Quantized atomic vibrations

In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in
a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the
Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of
equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was
aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be
difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a
particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could
solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye
refined this model./25®!

Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables

Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After
Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr
was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed
by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the
elements.

Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments that Wilhelm
Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium
state allows the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple
shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity that
is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified
this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.

Bose—Einstein statistics

In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath
Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of
indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the
proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift fur Physik.
Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the
Bose—Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low

temperatures.!259! It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by
Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST—JILA laboratory
