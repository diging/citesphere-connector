In 1911, Einstein used his 1907 equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another
star by the Sun's gravity. In 1913, Einstein improved upon those calculations by using the curvature of
spacetime to represent the gravity field. By the fall of 1915, Einstein had successfully completed his
general theory of relativity, which he used to calculate that deflection, and the perihelion precession of
Mercury.!5°1l94] In 1919, that deflection prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the
solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making
Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a
banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science — New Theory of the Universe — Newtonian Ideas
Overthrown" 951

In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.!96 In
1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and
especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".4°! While the general theory of
relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited
photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was
considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck
spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in
1921."4! He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.4!

Einstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. Einstein's scientific accomplishments
while in Berlin, included finishing the general theory of relativity, proving the Einstein—de Haas effect,
contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and Bose-Einstein statistics. '5°

1921-1922: Travels abroad

Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921,
where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis
Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions.!97! He
went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and
Princeton University, and in Washington, he accompanied
representatives of the National Academy of Sciences on a visit to
the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the
British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London,
where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual, and

political figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College
Einstein with his second wife, Elsa, [98][990]
London.19°1199

In 1921

 

He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.", in

July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics
of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy
in America (1835).!0°! For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a
visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and
without envy."201

In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and
speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to
thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial
Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the

Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.4°2! In his own travel
