The New York Times reported
confirmation of "the Einstein theory"
(specifically, the bending of light by
gravitation) based on 29 May 1919
eclipse observations in Príncipe
(Africa) and Sobral (Brazil), after the
findings were presented on 6
November 1919 to a joint meeting in
London of the Royal Society and the
Royal Astronomical Society.[88]
in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in
1909.[83]
Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand
University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the
Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.[84][85] During his Prague stay, he
wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on
the quantum theory of solids.
In July 1912, he returned to his alma
mater in Zürich. From 1912 until
1914, he was a professor of
theoretical physics at the ETH
Zurich, where he taught analytical
mechanics and thermodynamics. He
also studied continuum mechanics,
the molecular theory of heat, and the
problem of gravitation, on which he
worked with mathematician and
friend Marcel Grossmann.[86]
When the "Manifesto of the Ninety-Three" was published in
October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent
German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World War—
Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic
"Manifesto to the Europeans".[87]
In the spring of 1913, Einstein was enticed to move to Berlin with
an offer that included membership in the Prussian Academy of
Sciences, and a linked University of Berlin professorship, enabling
him to concentrate exclusively on research.[56] On 3 July 1913, he
became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.
Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in
Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering
him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
Physics, which was soon to be established.[89] Membership in the
academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching
duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected
to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following
year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the
prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a
romantic affair. Einstein assumed his position with the academy,
and Berlin University,[90] after moving into his Dahlem apartment
on 1 April 1914.[56][91] As World War I broke out that year, the
plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was delayed. The
institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its
director.[92] In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German
Physical Society (1916–1918).[93]
