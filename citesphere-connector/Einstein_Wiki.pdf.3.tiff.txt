follow."!3°! His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-
year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood
as a "mathematical structure".!3°! Einstein started teaching
himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had
"mastered integral and differential calculus".!34

At the age of 13, when he had become more seriously interested
in philosophy (and music),'32! Einstein was introduced to
Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite
philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child,
only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to
ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."/3°

In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance
examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zurich
(later the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He
failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the
examination,/33! but obtained exceptional grades in physics and
mathematics.!84! On the advice of the principal of the
polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school
(gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to
complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the
family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter,
Marie. Einstein's sister Maja later married Winteler's son
Paul.'35! In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein
renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of
Wiirttemberg to avoid military service.!3°! In September 1896
he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including
a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a
scale of 1-6.!37! At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics
and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal
polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older,
moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.!35!

Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva
Mari¢, also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year. She was
the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and
physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next
few years, Einstein's and Maric’s friendship developed into a
romance, and they spent countless hours debating and reading
books together on extra-curricular physics in which they were
both interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Maric that he
preferred studying alongside her.!3®! In 1900, Einstein passed
the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded a Federal
teaching diploma.!39! There is eyewitness evidence and several
letters over many years that indicate Maric might have
collaborated with Einstein prior to his landmark 1905
papers, !38Il40Il41] known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and
that they developed some of the concepts together during their
