Einstein in 1947
Start of a speech by Albert Einstein
made on 11 April 1943 for the
United Jewish Appeal (recording by
Radio Universidad Nacional de La
Plata, Argentina)
"Ladies (coughs) and gentlemen,
our age is proud of the progress it
has made in man's intellectual
development. The search and
striving for truth and knowledge is
one of the highest of man's
qualities ..."
Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as
malaria, which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the
country's development.[171] He also promoted the establishment of an
Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both
Hebrew and Arabic.[172]
Einstein was not a nationalist and was against the creation of an
independent Jewish state, which would be established without his help as
Israel in 1948. He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could
live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine.[173] Nevertheless, upon the
death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister
David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of
President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach.[174][175] The offer was
presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who
explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish
people can repose in any of its sons".[176] Einstein wrote that he was "deeply moved", but "at once
saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it.[176]
Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original
writings and interviews.[177] He said he had sympathy for the
impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy.[178]
He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with
fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as
naïve.[179] He clarified, however, that "I am not an atheist",[180]
preferring to call himself an agnostic,[181][182] or a "deeply
religious nonbeliever".[179] When asked if he believed in an
afterlife, Einstein replied, "No. And one life is enough for me."[183]
Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and
Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the
advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York,[184] and
was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which
publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of
the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of
Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious
idealism. He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."[185]
In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:
The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human
weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are
nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change
this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most
childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose
mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I
cannot see anything 'chosen' about them.[186]
