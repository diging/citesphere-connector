Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey's Prime Minister, Ismet Inonut, to

whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As
a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved

individuals" 1435]

Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during
which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in
Europe.36] In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same
time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied
citizenship elsewhere.!437! In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should
be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.!°te 311138] Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then
accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to
become a resident scholar. 136!

Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study

On 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of
academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in
London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout.!422
Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the
Institute for Advanced Study,!13°l39] noted for having become a refuge
for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.!4°! At the time, most American
universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no
Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted
until the late 1940s.149!

 

Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several
European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where he stayed _ Portrait of Einstein taken in
for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered 1935 at Princeton

a five-year research fellowship (called a "studentship" at Christ

Church), 4142] but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain

permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship. 436/143]

Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.44! He
was one of the four first selected (along with John von Neumann, Kurt Godel, and Hermann
Weyl!145]) at the new Institute. He soon developed a close friendship with Godel; the two would take
long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist.
During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted
interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.

World War Il and the Manhattan Project

In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leo Szilard attempted to alert
Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein
and Szilard, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their
responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build
an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a
weapon."!!46L147] To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before
the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility
