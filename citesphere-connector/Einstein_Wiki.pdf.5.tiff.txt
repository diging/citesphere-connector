Einstein's son Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.!©7!
His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally, after her
death, being committed permanently to Burghélzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Ziirich.!©®!

Patent office

After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two years searching for a
teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901,/6% but
was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel
Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent
Office,/7°17] as an assistant examiner — level IIJ.!72I[73]

Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a

gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.!73! In 1903, his
position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was
passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine

technology".{74!

 

Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about
transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization
of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that
eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental
connection between space and time.43!

With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-
mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.
Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate.!75! Their
readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his
scientific and philosophical outlook.!7®!

First scientific papers

In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritatserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the
Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik.!7Z![78] On 30 April 1905
Einstein completed his dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions!72! with Alfred
Kleiner, serving as pro-forma advisor./79//8°] His thesis was accepted in July 1905, and Einstein was
awarded a PhD on 15 January 1906_!79//8oll81]

Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four
groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the
equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the
age of 26,!82!

Academic career

By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.
The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the
University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship
