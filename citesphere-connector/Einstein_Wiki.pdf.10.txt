Albert Einstein's landing card (26
May 1933), when he landed in
Dover (United Kingdom) from
Ostend (Belgium) to visit Oxford
March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag had
passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler's government
into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to
proceed to Berlin. Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided
by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in
Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the
German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his
German citizenship.[124] The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his
cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.[125]
In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had
passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including
teaching at universities.[124] Historian Gerald Holton describes
how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their
colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced
to give up their university positions and their names were removed
from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.[126]
A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the
German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi
propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, "Jewish
intellectualism is dead."[124] One German magazine included him
in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet
hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.[124][127] In a
subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had
already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "... I
must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came
as something of a surprise."[124] After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a
"spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment", and "more than
anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence".[128]
Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally
worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. Aided by the Academic Assistance
Council, founded in April 1933 by British liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics
escape Nazi persecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany.[129] He rented a house in De Haan,
Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at
the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become
friends with Einstein in the preceding years.[130] Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer
home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein,
Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin; a photo of them carrying
shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.[131][132]
Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain
and former Prime Minister Lloyd George.[133] Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out
of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his
friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in
British universities.[134] Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews
out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put the Allies' technology ahead of theirs.[134]
