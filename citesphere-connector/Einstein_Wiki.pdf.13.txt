Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.[158] Einstein has
said, "Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as
victims of discrimination".[155]
In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German
Democratic Party, a liberal party.[160] Later in his life, Einstein's
political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism,
which he detailed in his essays such as "Why Socialism?"[161][162]
His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he
criticized them for not having a 'well-regulated system of
government' and called their rule a 'regime of terror and a tragedy
in human history'. He later adopted a more moderated view,
criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his
1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: "In Lenin I honor a man, who in
total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to
realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One
thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and
renewers of mankind's conscience."[163] Einstein offered and was
called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often
unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.[136] He strongly
advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would
check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.[164] He wrote "I advocate
world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most
terrible danger in which man has ever found himself."[165] The FBI created a secret dossier on
Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.[166]
Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he exchanged written letters. He
described Gandhi as "a role model for the generations to come".[167] The initial connection was
established on 27 September 1931, when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram to meet
his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi's disciple and
special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader's home in
1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his
envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi
were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through
Wilfrid Israel.[168]
Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,[169] which
opened in 1925. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist
Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university.[170] He made
suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of
