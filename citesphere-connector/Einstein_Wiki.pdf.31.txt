1. In the German Empire, citizens were exclusively subjects of one of the 27 Bundesstaaten.
2. Einstein's scores on his Matura certificate: German 5; French 3; Italian 5; History 6; Geography 4;
Algebra 6; Geometry 6; Descriptive Geometry 6; Physics 6; Chemistry 5; Natural History 5; Art
Drawing 4; Technical Drawing 4.
Scale: 6 = very good, 5 = good, 4 = sufficient, 3 = insufficient, 2 = poor, 1 = very poor.
3. "Their leaders in Germany have not driven out her cut-throats and her blackguards. She has
chosen the cream of her culture and has suppressed it. She has even turned upon her most
glorious citizen, Albert Einstein, who is the supreme example of the selfless intellectual...The man,
who, beyond all others, approximates a citizen of the world, is without a home. How proud we
must be to offer him temporary shelter."
4. In his paper, Einstein wrote: "The introduction of a 'luminiferous æther' will be proved to be
superfluous in so far, as according to the conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce
neither a 'space absolutely at rest' endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a
velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place."
5. For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different
controversies it encountered, see the articles in Glick (1987).
6. In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a
three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking
electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as
saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's
efficiency to be quadrupled.[275]
