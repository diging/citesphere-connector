Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrodinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose—
Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box
associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an
integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin
Schrodinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas.
Schrodinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the
invitation.|273!

Einstein refrigerator

In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leo Szilard co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein
refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using
only heat as an input.274! On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 (https://patents.google.com/p
atent/US1781541) was awarded to Einstein and Leo Szilard for the refrigerator. Their invention was
not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were
acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.™“¢ ©!

Non-scientific legacy

 

While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted
stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the
papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot
Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the
public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after
her death (she died in 1986!27°!). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew
University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are
about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912

and 1955./277!

 

Einstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal picnic in Oslo in 1920. Heinrich

is the exclusive representative of that right.!279! Corbis, successor
to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the

Mount Einstein in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named in 1955.

Mount Einstein in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research.!254
