Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by
generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include
electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated
from the mainstream of modern physics.
Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to
Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a
subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the following
year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics
and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal
polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he
acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life,
and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss
Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the
University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order
to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt
University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German
citizen again, this time Prussian.
In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf
Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein objected to the
policies of the newly elected Nazi government;[17] he settled in
the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.[18]
On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President
Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German
nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US
begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but
generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.[19]
Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[5] in the Kingdom of
Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a
family of secular Ashkenazi Jews.[20][21] His parents were
Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.
In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father
and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J.
Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical
equipment based on direct current.[5]
Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from
the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was
transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the
