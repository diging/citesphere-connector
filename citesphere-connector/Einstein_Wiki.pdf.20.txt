Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin
Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the
universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The
Friedmann–Einstein universe of 1931[242][243] and the Einstein–
de Sitter universe of 1932.[244][245] In each of these models,
Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was
"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory".[242][243][246]
In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred
to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder",
based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from
him. The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this
claim.[247]
In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac
O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the
recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe.[248][249] In a
hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the
expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of
matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.[250][251] As he stated in the paper, "In
what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's
[sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded
volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new
particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."
It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years
before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.[252][253] However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a
fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.[250][251][254]
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved
energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a
Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into
something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by
Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.
Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to
vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum
pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational
field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become
standard.
The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin
Schrödinger and others.
